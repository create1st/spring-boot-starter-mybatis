Spring Boot MyBatis Starter

This is unofficial Spring Boot Starter for MyBatis

In opposite to official [MyBatis Spring Boot support](https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-spring-boot) it is following 
the convention of other Spring Boot data repositories and implements proper Spring Data interfaces.
Advantage of such approach is almost zero effort on switching the persistence layer.
