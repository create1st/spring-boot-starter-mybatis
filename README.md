Spring Boot MyBatis Starter

This is unofficial Spring Boot Starter for MyBatis

In opposite to official MyBatis support available at https://github.com/mybatis/mybatis-spring-boot it is following 
the convention of other Spring Boot data repositories and implements proper Spring Data interfaces.
Advantage of such approach is almost zero effort on switching the persistence layer.
